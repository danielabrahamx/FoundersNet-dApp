# FoundersNet Program Deployment Info

## Program Build Status
✅ **SUCCESSFULLY BUILT** with Anchor CLI 0.32.1

### Build Details
- **Anchor Version**: 0.32.1
- **Rust Version**: 1.92.0
- **Solana CLI Version**: 3.0.13
- **Program Binary**: `/home/engine/project/target/deploy/foundersnet.so` (257,792 bytes)
- **IDL Generated**: `/home/engine/project/target/deploy/foundersnet.json` (11,553 bytes)

## Program ID (Pre-Generated)
```
BxWFLkQQhJd93ME3Vc1K5JKynx3i59Ni82i9rLgiCAoM
```

This program ID has been:
- ✅ Generated by Anchor build process
- ✅ Updated in `Anchor.toml` under `[programs.devnet]`
- ✅ Updated in program source code (`programs/foundersnet/src/lib.rs`)
- ⏳ **PENDING**: Deployment to Devnet (awaiting sufficient SOL balance)

## Deployment Status
**Status**: ⏳ **READY TO DEPLOY** (pending devnet SOL funds)

### Deployment Requirements
- **Required SOL**: ~1.8 SOL (1.7954364 SOL program rent + 0.001365 SOL fee)
- **Current Balance**: 1.0 SOL
- **Needed**: ~0.8 SOL more

### Deployment Wallet
```
B6kiybmd6qitQvHh5ktAtpRuCuMJrbYTWZWdqdXwFm3j
```

**Note**: Devnet faucet rate limits are preventing immediate deployment. The program is built and ready to deploy once sufficient devnet SOL is obtained.

## Devnet Configuration
- **RPC Endpoint**: https://api.devnet.solana.com
- **Cluster**: devnet
- **Wallet Path**: ~/.config/solana/id.json

## Deployment Command (Ready to Execute)
```bash
cd /home/engine/project
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

Or using Solana CLI directly:
```bash
solana program deploy target/deploy/foundersnet.so \
  --program-id target/deploy/foundersnet-keypair.json \
  --url devnet
```

## Frontend Configuration
Once deployment is complete, update `/client/.env`:
```env
VITE_PROGRAM_ID=BxWFLkQQhJd93ME3Vc1K5JKynx3i59Ni82i9rLgiCAoM
VITE_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
VITE_SOLANA_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://api.devnet.solana.com
VITE_ADMIN_WALLET=78BDAjB4oTdjS4S734Ge2sRWWnHGDDJmPigbp27bSQ7g
```

## Solscan Link (After Deployment)
```
https://solscan.io/account/BxWFLkQQhJd93ME3Vc1K5JKynx3i59Ni82i9rLgiCAoM?cluster=devnet
```

## Program Features

- ✅ Event/Market creation with initial liquidity
- ✅ YES/NO betting system with minimum bet validation
- ✅ Automated Market Maker (AMM) pool management
- ✅ Admin-only event resolution
- ✅ Winner claim mechanism with payout calculation

## Next Steps
1. ⏳ **Obtain additional devnet SOL** (~0.8 SOL needed)
   - Wait for faucet rate limit reset
   - Use alternative devnet faucets:
     - https://faucet.solana.com
     - https://faucet.quicknode.com/solana/devnet
     - https://solfaucet.com
2. ⏳ **Execute deployment command**
3. ⏳ **Verify deployment on Solscan**
4. ⏳ **Update frontend .env with deployed Program ID**
5. ⏳ **Test frontend integration with live program**

2. **QuickNode Faucet** (https://faucet.quicknode.com/solana/devnet)
   - Enter wallet: `B6kiybmd6qitQvHh5ktAtpRuCuMJrbYTWZWdqdXwFm3j`
   - Request up to 10 SOL

3. **SOL Faucet** (https://solfaucet.com)
   - Select Devnet
   - Enter wallet: `B6kiybmd6qitQvHh5ktAtpRuCuMJrbYTWZWdqdXwFm3j`
   - Request 1-5 SOL
