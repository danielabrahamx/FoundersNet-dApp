# tech-stack.md: FoundersNet (Minimalist Devnet dApp)

This document outlines the proposed technology stack for the new, minimalist version of FoundersNet, focusing exclusively on a **pure decentralized application (dApp)** that interacts directly with the **Solana Devnet**. This approach prioritizes simplicity and direct blockchain interaction, eliminating the need for a separate backend server or relational database.

## 1. Project Overview

FoundersNet is a decentralized prediction market platform. This version is a proof-of-concept/minimal viable product (MVP) built as a **pure dApp**. All market state, user data (via wallet addresses), and core logic reside entirely on the Solana blockchain. The application is designed to be as simple as possible for rapid development and Devnet testing.

## 2. Core Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React | Latest (v18+) | Industry standard for building dynamic, high-performance user interfaces. |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Latest | Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, consistent, and responsive UI development. |
| **UI Components** | Shadcn UI / Radix UI | Latest | Headless, accessible components for building a professional-grade user experience. |
| **Language** | TypeScript | Latest | Provides static type checking across the entire stack, reducing runtime errors and improving code quality. |
| **Blockchain** | Solana (Devnet) | Latest | High-throughput, low-latency blockchain platform for core market logic. Targeting **Devnet** for all testing and deployment. |
| **Smart Contracts** | Anchor Framework | Latest | Developer framework for Solana programs, providing necessary tools for building secure and robust smart contracts. |

## 3. Application Architecture

The application follows a simple, two-tier dApp architecture:

1.  **Client (Frontend):** A React Single-Page Application (SPA) responsible for the user interface. It handles all user interactions, wallet connections, and directly communicates with the Solana Devnet via RPC calls.
2.  **Logic Layer (Solana):** The Solana blockchain hosts the smart contracts (programs) which contain all the core business logic for market creation, trading, and resolution. The blockchain serves as the single source of truth for all application state.

**Note:** There is **no separate backend server** (e.g., Node.js/Express) or **relational database** (e.g., PostgreSQL). All data is read directly from the Solana network.

## 4. Directory Structure

The project will adopt a structure that clearly separates the client-side presentation from the on-chain logic.

/foundersnet-minimal
├── client/          # React/Vite/TypeScript frontend application
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/   # Custom hooks for Solana interaction (e.g., useWallet, useMarket)

└── smart_contracts/
└── solana/      # Anchor program for the prediction market logic
├── programs/

└── Anchor.toml


## 5. Integration Strategy

*   **Blockchain Interaction:** The client will use the **`@solana/web3.js`** library and the **Anchor client** to directly interact with the smart contracts for all transactions (e.g., creating a market, placing a trade).
*   **Data Retrieval:** All market data and user-specific information will be fetched directly from the Solana Devnet using the program's account data structures.
*   **Type Safety:** TypeScript will be used end-to-end, with shared types generated by the Anchor framework to ensure data consistency between the smart contracts and the frontend.

## 6. Development Environment

*   **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (or equivalent Linux/macOS environment)
*   **Runtime:** Node.js (LTS)
*   **Package Manager:** pnpm or npm
*   **Testing:** Vitest (Frontend Unit), Anchor Test (Smart Contracts)
*   **Local Blockchain:** Solana Test Validator (`solana-test-validator`) for local development and testing before deploying to Devnet.
